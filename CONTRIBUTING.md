# Contributing to AI Wellness Agent

Thanks for stopping by! 🎉  
Right now this is a solo‑maintained project, but contributions are welcome — whether it’s bug reports, feature ideas, documentation tweaks, or code improvements.

## 🛠 How to Contribute

### Reporting Issues
- Use the **Issues** tab to report bugs, request features, or ask questions.
- Please check if a similar issue already exists before opening a new one.
- Provide as much detail as possible (steps to reproduce, screenshots, logs).

### Submitting Changes
Since this is a solo project, the workflow is simple:
1. **Clone** the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/ai-wellness-agent.git
2. Create a new branch for your work:
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
3. Make your changes and commit:
git commit -m "feat: add new wellness tracking API"
4. Push your branch:
git push origin feature/your-feature-name
5. Open a Pull Request against main.
(If you’re not comfortable with PRs, you can also share patches or ideas via Issues.)

📐 Coding Guidelines
Python (backend/ml): Follow PEP8 style guide.
React (frontend): Use ESLint + Prettier for consistent formatting.
Write unit tests for new features.
Keep commits small and focused.

🔄 Workflow
All changes go through Pull Requests (even mine, for history and CI checks).
GitHub Actions run automatically (lint, tests, build).
As the solo maintainer, I’ll merge once checks pass.

🤝 Community Standards
Be respectful and inclusive (see Code of Conduct).
Collaborate openly — feedback is welcome.
Document your changes clearly.

🚀 Getting Started
See the README.md for project overview and roadmap.
Check the Project Board for current phases and tasks.
Issues labeled good first issue are a great entry point.

📧 Questions?
Open an issue with the question label. Since this is solo‑maintained, I’ll respond when I can.
